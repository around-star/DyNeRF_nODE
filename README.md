# DyNeRF_nODE

We tackle the problem of reconstruction and modeling of the underlying dynamics of a scene. We design a novel setup using NeRF and neural ODE. The NeRF learns the spatial information of a scene and the nODE learns the various dynamics in the scene. Our setup can not only reconstruct the original scene, but 
* Extrapolates beyond the scene trajectory
* Generalizes across different physical parameters (friction) of the scene
* Generalizes across different initial condition (position, velocity) of the scene
